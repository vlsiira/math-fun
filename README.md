# Week 1 
## Lab Part Two

Today in lab you will create solutions to some code problems and practice a git workflow. 

**Be sure to follow instructions carefully.**

Here are a couple of things to keep in mind:

* Place no function calls in your code, unless inside of another function. Everything should be run by hand from the console. This is to give you additional practice using the console and practice efficient app-switching processes.
* Create a new branch for each code problem, and when the problem is completed, merge its branch into *master* on GitHub. Do the problems in order. **Don't forget to pull the updated master branch from GitHub into your local master branch each time.**
    1. fork the class repo
    2. clone your fork to your computer
    3. create a branch and work on problem one
    4. when your test passes, commit and push your branch to GitHub
    5. merge your solution into master in GitHub
        1. go to your fork of the repo 
        2. hit the `New pull request button`
        3. change **base fork** to your fork
        4. change **compare** to the branch you want to merge
        5. go through the steps to merge the two branches
        6. when the merge is complete, pull the updated master branch to your computer `git pull origin master`
    6. repeat steps 3-5 for each problem
* Although this is an individual lab assignment, do feel free to (heck, it is *encouraged* that you) collaborate and work in pairs or groups.
* You are being given starter code for today, in the index.html and app.js files inside of this directory. The success of your code will be determined by whether it passes tests that are in tests.js file. You do not need to do anything with tests.js, though you should take a look at it to see how it works.


### Submitting Your Assignment

- Submit the link to your GitHub repo for this project.

> Assignments that do not meet the required professional standards will not be graded. We’ll ask you to update your work to meet the requirements and resubmit. Required professional standards include:
a clear commit history with commit messages that describe why the changes were made; your code passes an eslint test.
